# Python-NN_Plant_Health_Detector
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting potato plant diseases through image recognition of their leaves. Using neural networks, the goal is to develop an algorithm capable of early identification of pathologies, thereby improving crop management and control.

The dataset used contains high-resolution images of potato plant leaves exhibiting various diseases, including early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves. The utility of this project lies in its ability to support farmers in optimizing productivity, reducing the use of pesticides and chemical interventions, and ensuring superior crop quality, while contributing to environmental sustainability and food safety.
